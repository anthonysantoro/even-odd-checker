# even-odd-checker
This is a program I created with the general guidance of GrokAI as a simple project to learn Python and to learn. 
This started with a very basic program that requested the user input a valid non-negative integer, and would spit out a response and tell you if its even/odd. 
Since, I've added error-handling to reject negative integers, anything that isn't an integer, and numbers beyond 10**6 as being 'too large.' I've also made it
have a maximum number of attempts where the current number of attempts goes up and only allows 3 attempts at inputting a valid non-negative integer.

I also have a retry feature that asks the user if they'd like to retry and input another number.

A few of my planned features are below.

- Allowing multiple numbers to be checked at once.
- Introducing a prime number checker.
- Introducing a feature to reverse, randomize or sort lists of numbers.
- Saving previous checked numbers in a .txt file.

My reason for building this, especially while using GrokAI which some may look down upon, is because it acts almost as a teacher and so far has made the process of learning
Python more enjoyable, and has made it interactive/nudged me in directions I wouldn't have otherwise known to go with this project.
